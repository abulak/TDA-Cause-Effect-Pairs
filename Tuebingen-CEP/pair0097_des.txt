Information for pair0097

initial and final speed of a ball on a ball track for children

The data has been recorded by Dominik Janzing using a ball track that has been equipped with two pairs of light barriers. The first one measures the initial speed and the second one the speed of a ball at some later position of the track. The initial part of the track 
has large slope. The initial speed is strongly determined by the exact position where the ball is put on the track. For part of the runs, the position of the ball has been chosen by D. Janzing, the other part by a 4-year old child. This should avoid that the variation of the initial position is done in a too systematic way.
